# Chapter II

(avr. time for this chapter: 2 days)

Ruby on Rails (simplified as Rails) is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. 

This second chapter is geared towards learning rails. You don't need to write code (just what you think will help you), you need to understand how rails works

The course we offer you has several chapters that you can read, but in this case we are focused on the essentials for the next chapters.

The idea is to pay attention to the chapter you are listening to and repeat it if you have any doubts.
  
***So, let's learn some new things***
