# Chapter I
    (avr. time for this chapter: 1 day)
Hi. 
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. 

In this chapter the objective is to look at the world of ruby, which will serve as a basis for the next chapters where we will be delving into one of the frameworks that work with ruby, Rails.

The idea is to familiarize yourself with the basics.

***So, let's do some code***
